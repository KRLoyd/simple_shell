.SH NAME
- Simple_shell(hsh) - command line interpreter

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B hsh [file [arg...]]

.SH DESCRIPTION
Simple Shell is a basic imitation of a command line interpreter that reads and implements basic commands from user input as a shell would. The shell is a command that reads lines from either a file or the terminal, interprets them, and generally executes other commands. Simple Shell is compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS with gcc 4.8.4 (C90). It is built to run in both interactive and noninteractive mode.

.SH SIMPLE COMMANDS
 If a simple command has been recognized, the shell performs the following actions:
.IP 1.
.IP 2.
.IP 3.

.SH SEARCH AND EXECUTION
There are three types of commands: shell functions, built-in commands, and normal programs. The command is searched for (by name) in that order. The three types of commands are all executed in a different way.

.SH PATH SEARCH
When locating a command, the shell first looks to see if it has a shell function by that name. Then it looks for a built-in command by that name. If a built-in command is not found, one of two things happen:
.IP 1.
.IP 2.

.SH BUILTINS
.IP env
Prints out all environment variables
.IP exit
Exits process and frees memory allocated.

.SH BUGS
